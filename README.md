# Hangman Game

Hangman Game is a Python based terminal game running on the code institute mock terminal on Heroku. 

### It's a word guessing game!

## Instructions 

Hangman Game is a classic game where you guess the letter of a word. 
Guessing it right makes you continue until you have filled out the whole word. 
Guessing it wrong makes you loose a try, if you guess incorrectly six times it is game over! 

## Features 

- Five different words to guess 
- Counter for the amount of extra lives you have left

- Continuing inputing letters results in a win or a lose
- You must enter letters 

### For the future 

- Making parts of a figure appear if the wrong letters are chosen 
- Extended word selection

## Testing 
I tested the game with the following methods: 
- Play testing it myself, seeing it working as intended
- Used the PEP8 linter validator
