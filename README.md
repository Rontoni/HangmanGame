# Hangman Game

Hangman Game is a Python based terminal game running on the code institute mock terminal on Heroku. 

### It's a word guessing game!

## Instructions 

Hangman Game is a classic game where you guess the letter of a word. 
Guessing it right makes you continue until you have filled out the whole word. 
Guessing it wrong makes you loose a try, if you guess incorrectly six times it is game over! 

## Features 

- Five different words to guess 
- Counter for the amount of extra lives you have left
